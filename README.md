## Functionalities

 ### An unified community:
 <p> Students will be able to communicate through a chat, which will facilitate collaboration and the exchange of ideas in real time. They will also be able to access the profiles of whoever they want in the chat with one click. They will be able to create relationships with people from their own university, with similar interests, so that there is joint development and progress in the social aspect of university students.
 </p>  

 ### Systems of notifications:
 <p> For better communication between the university and its activities, as well as the opportunities that exist for students. With an educational community more informed about the events organized by each club, organization or the university itself, students will be able to take advantage of these opportunities to meet more contacts, develop their soft skills and improve their interpersonal interaction capabilities.
 </p>  

 ### Gamification: 
 <p>Rocky is a geode and virtual pet from whom you can buy cosmetics with “Rockie coins”, offering various customization options to express yourself. Furthermore, Rocky directly represents the person using the application: As the user develops with care and discipline, little by little they will see their true inner qualities and potential, thus showing the beauty of our interior, like Rocky, the geode. 
 </p>  

 ### Modules:
 - **Meditation and Time** : Timers to meditate and usage of the “Pomodoro” study technique. This way students can concentrate better on their studies. Depending on how long you meditate or use the “Pomodoro” you will be awarded a number of “Rockie coins”.

 - **Exercise** : By watching the videos completely you are rewarded with “Rockie coins”. In this way, they will be able to lead a healthier life.
 
 - **Habit tracker** : It's the most important functionality, it tells you which habits you are fulfilling weekly. In addition, it allows you to select which ones you want to receive tracking of and have personalized habits.

 - **Sleep** : We plan to set a “time to sleep” and “time to wake up” checkers to improve sleeping periods.

 ### Time organization:

 - This option will allow the user to establish and define a list of activities that they wish to carry out throughout the day and week similar to Google Calendar, providing information about dates of obligations and commitments to be taken into consideration periodically.
